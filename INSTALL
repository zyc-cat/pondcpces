1. Download CUDD 2.4.2 by Fabio Somenzi

2. Extract it to a place that has no spaces in the path

3. Build CUDD on your machine -
   x86_64 Linux machines may need the following in the Makefile (notice 16 instead of 8):
   XCFLAGS	= -mtune=native -DHAVE_IEEE_754 -DBSD -DSIZEOF_VOID_P=16 -DSIZEOF_LONG=16

4. Run the following commands from the top POND directory:

svn update
export CUDD_HOME=<absolute path to the top cudd directory>
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
